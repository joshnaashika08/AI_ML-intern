## 🔍 Observations:

1. **Age**: Most passengers were between 20–40 years old. Some outliers were older than 70.
2. **Fare**: Right-skewed distribution with outliers above $300. First-class tickets were much more expensive.
3. **Sex**: Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates.
4. **Pclass**: 1st class passengers had the highest survival rates, followed by 2nd, then 3rd.
5. **Correlation**:
   - `Fare` negatively correlated with `Pclass` (lower Pclass = lower fare).
   - `Sex` and `Survived` had a strong relationship (females survived more).
6. **Outliers**:
   - Notable outliers in `Fare`, potentially very wealthy passengers.

## 📌 Conclusions:

- Features like **Sex**, **Pclass**, and **Fare** are strong indicators of survival.
- **Age** and **Fare** may benefit from transformation or binning for modeling.
- **Outliers** should be handled carefully to avoid skewing models.
